PHP Wrapper for Project Honey Pot. Compatible with PHP 5.3+ and HHVM.

## Installation

The preferred installation method is via `composer`. First add the following
to your `composer.json`

```json
"require": {
    "joshtronic/php-projecthoneypot": "dev-master"
}
```

Then run `composer update`

## Usage

### Getting Started

```php
$php = new joshtronic\ProjectHoneyPot('_YOUR_API_KEY_');
```

### Performing a Lookup

```php
$results = $php->query('1.2.3.4');
print_r($results);
```

### Results

Queries will return an array of information about the IP address. The array
will contain `last_activity`, `threat_score` and an array of `categories`.

### Simulating Results

The folks at Project Honey Pot were kind enough to include a way to simulate
results from their http:BL API. You can do so by performing queries against
the following IP addresses.

#### Visitor Types

* 127.1.1.0 - Search Engine

## Contributing

Suggestions and bug reports are always welcome, but karma points are earned
for pull requests.

Unit tests are required for all contributions. You can run the test suite from
the `tests` directory simply by running `phpunit .`

I also urge you to install a honey pot and donate some MX records to Project
Honey Pot. They are doing great work, they provide http:BL as a free service
and your donations help make their service ever better!
